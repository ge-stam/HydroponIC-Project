This library supports the following devices \+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item DS18\+B20
\item DS18\+S20 -\/ Please note there appears to be an issue with this series.
\item DS1822
\item DS1820
\item MAX31820
\end{DoxyItemize}

You will need a pull-\/up resistor of about 5 KOhm between the 1-\/Wire data line and your 5V power. If you are using the DS18\+B20, ground pins 1 and 3. The centre pin is the data line \textquotesingle{}1-\/wire\textquotesingle{}.

In case of temperature conversion problems (result is {\ttfamily -\/85}), strong pull-\/up setup may be necessary. See section {\itshape Powering the DS18\+B20} in \href{https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS18B20.pdf}{\texttt{ DS18\+B20 datasheet}} (page 7) and use {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_dallas_temperature}{Dallas\+Temperature(\+One\+Wire$\ast$, uint8\+\_\+t)}}} constructor.

We have included a \char`\"{}\+REQUIRESNEW\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}\+REQUIRESALARMS\char`\"{} definition. If you want to slim down the code feel free to use either of these by including

\begin{DoxyVerb}#define REQUIRESNEW 
\end{DoxyVerb}
 or \begin{DoxyVerb}#define REQUIRESALARMS
\end{DoxyVerb}


at the top of \mbox{\hyperlink{_dallas_temperature_8h_source}{Dallas\+Temperature.\+h}}

Finally, please include One\+Wire from Paul Stoffregen in the library manager before you begin.\hypertarget{md_lib__dallas_temperature__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md37}{}\doxysection{Credits}\label{md_lib__dallas_temperature__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md37}
The One\+Wire code has been derived from \href{http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Learning/OneWire}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+arduino.\+cc/playground/\+Learning/\+One\+Wire}}. Miles Burton \href{mailto:miles@mnetcs.com}{\texttt{ miles@mnetcs.\+com}} originally developed this library. Tim Newsome \href{mailto:nuisance@casualhacker.net}{\texttt{ nuisance@casualhacker.\+net}} added support for multiple sensors on the same bus. Guil Barros \mbox{[}\href{mailto:gfbarros@bappos.com}{\texttt{ gfbarros@bappos.\+com}}\mbox{]} added get\+Temp\+By\+Address (v3.\+5) Note\+: these are implemented as get\+Temp\+C(address) and get\+Temp\+F(address) Rob Tillaart \mbox{[}\href{mailto:rob.tillaart@gmail.com}{\texttt{ rob.\+tillaart@gmail.\+com}}\mbox{]} added async modus (v3.\+7.\+0)\hypertarget{md_lib__dallas_temperature__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md38}{}\doxysection{Website}\label{md_lib__dallas_temperature__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md38}
